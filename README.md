# Paper

This open source project provides resources for creating and rendering 
"documents" (in the loosest sense of the word).

The [Paper API](/paper-api) module provides a few minimal
interfaces, with the aim of smoothing out the differences between how
various document formats and rendering engines/protocols might actually
work under the hood. The API should be treated just as that: a facade
around some more complex, but by these means interchangeable, behavior.
The broader goal of this API is to encourage a collaborative approach to
working with documents in Java.

The [Paper Plugins](/paper-plugins) module provides some useful
implementations, but it is not necessary to create a Paper project.

## Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome! This project is open source and, at
this point, really just a hobby of its creator.
